# Practical 1 - Build Your Own Pangenome

There are many notions of what a pangenome is:

- A sequence graph representing the variation present in the set of genomes
- A compressed index of each genome as a text that is queryable
- A catalog of variation and conservation

In this practical session, we will run a few tools that “build” different notions of a pangenome and walk through how each lets us visualize and query our dataset.

**Docker Image with all the tools pre-installed:** [vikshiv/scalable-course:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/vikshiv/scalable-course) (`linux/amd64`)

**Course data (FTP):** [https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/research-team/shivakumar/scalable_course/](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/research-team/shivakumar/scalable_course/)

## Learning objectives

In this practical you will:

1. Run each tool on a small set of genome assemblies
2. Understand the inputs and outputs of each method
3. Explain the pros and cons of each method, including which method is appropriate for different types of pangenomes

## 0) Pull the docker container and datasets

See the course informatics guide for full setup instructions. After unpacking the course archives into `datasets/` (AGCs) and `data/` (pre-built outputs) in your working directory, start an interactive session with both directories mounted:

**Docker:**

```bash
docker pull vikshiv/scalable-course:latest

mkdir -p work
docker run --rm -it \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -v "$PWD/datasets:/data/datasets:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/data:/data/data:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/work:/data/work" \
  vikshiv/scalable-course:latest
```

**Singularity / Apptainer:**

```bash
apptainer pull scalable-course.sif docker://vikshiv/scalable-course:latest

mkdir -p work
apptainer shell \
  --bind "$PWD/datasets:/data/datasets:ro,$PWD/data:/data/data:ro,$PWD/work:/data/work" \
  scalable-course.sif
```

> Use `singularity` in place of `apptainer` if that is what your cluster provides. On Apple Silicon (or other arm64 hosts), keep `--platform linux/amd64` for Docker.

Inside the container, AGCs are under `/data/datasets`, pre-built outputs under `/data/data`, and writable outputs under `/data/work`.

To test that the tools are installed and available:

```bash
which agc ropebwt3 syng impg BandageNG panacus vg mumemto shredtools panagram minimap2
```

We provided a few datasets to choose from depending on your computing setup and species of interest. We provide an AGC file for each dataset:

- *A. thaliana* full genomes (n=5)
- *A. thaliana* chr5 (n=5)
- Human full genomes (n=5)
- Human chr20 (n=5)
- *S. cerevisiae* full genomes (n=22)

Pick one of the above for this exercise or you may also run any of the tools on your own dataset of interest!
For an extra challenge, try running two of the above datasets and compare the outputs. 

---



## 1) Run each tool on your chosen dataset

In this section, we will run each of the tools on a dataset of your choosing. We will provide pre-computed outputs for the following sections, as some tools may be slow or memory intensive on personal machines.

We highly encourage you to use the help pages (`toolname -h`) and documentation to devise a command to run first. For each tool, we provide a command to run in the dropdown menu (using the yeast dataset as an example.)

```bash
AGC=/data/datasets/yeast_t2t_haploid.agc
DATA=/data/data
OUT=/data/work/
FASTA_DIR=$OUT/fastas
mkdir -p "$OUT" "$FASTA_DIR"
```



### AGC

[AGC](https://github.com/refresh-bio/agc) stores many genomes in one compressed archive. If you are using the provided datasets, you can use AGC to decompress the archives into a set of FASTA files.

Task: Inspect the AGC archive and decompress it into a set of FASTA files for the downstream tools.

<details>
<summary>Show agc example command</summary>

```bash
agc info "$AGC"
agc listset "$AGC" | head
agc getcol -o "$FASTA_DIR" "$AGC"
ls "$FASTA_DIR" | head
```

</details>

Inputs: an AGC archive (`.agc`)

Outputs: a directory of FASTA files (one file per sample)

### Mumemto / Shredtools

[Mumemto](https://github.com/vikshiv/mumemto) reports maximal unique matches across a set of assemblies. These matches represent conserved columns in the underlying multiple sequence alignment. Shredtools is a companion tool to Mumemto that indexes the MUMs list for querying.

Task: run Mumemto on the set of assemblies to create a `bumbl` file containing the MUMs. Then filter and index the set of MUMs for querying.

<details>
<summary>Show mumemto example command</summary>

```bash
mumemto -o "$OUT/mumemto" -b "$FASTA_DIR"/*.fa
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Show shredtools example command</summary>

```bash
shredtools filter -i "$OUT/mumemto.bumbl"
shredtools index --multi "$OUT/mumemto.bumbl" -v
```

</details>

Inputs: a set of FASTA files

Outputs: a `bumbl` file, a binary file that contains a list of exact matches and their locations in each assembly

<details>
<summary>How to view the output <code>bumbl</code> file</summary>

```bash
mumemto view "$OUT/mumemto.bumbl" | less
```

</details>

Extra exercises:

<details>
<summary>Compute the coverage of MUMs (how much of a given assembly is “shared” and unique across the pangenome?)</summary>

```bash
mumemto coverage -i "$OUT/mumemto.bumbl"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Compute the average MUM length</summary>

```bash
mumemto view "$OUT/mumemto.bumbl" | awk '{s+=$1;n++} END{print n?s/n:0}'
```

</details>

### ropebwt3

[ropebwt3](https://github.com/lh3/ropebwt3) builds an FM-index (a compressed text index) over the collection of genomes and supports MEM queries.

Task: Build an FM-index over the set of assemblies (dynamic `.fmr`, then static `.fmd`).

<details>
<summary>Show ropebwt3 example command</summary>

```bash
# constructs the dynamic version, needed initially to build the index
ropebwt3 build -bo "$OUT/rb3.fmr" "$FASTA_DIR"/*.fa
# constructs the static version, faster and more efficient to load, but no longer can add new assemblies
ropebwt3 build -i "$OUT/rb3.fmr" -do "$OUT/rb3.fmd"
```

</details>

Inputs: a set of FASTA files

Outputs: a dynamic BWT (`.fmr`) and a static FM-index (`.fmd`)

Extra exercise:

Compute the size of the BWT

```bash
ropebwt3 stat "$OUT/rb3.fmd"
```



---



### syng

[syng](https://github.com/richarddurbin/syng) builds a syncmer graph of the assemblies. Syncmers are specially chosen kmers that cover the full sequence, and are often shared across a pangenome. To navigate the graph, syng also builds a GBWT, which enables rapid stepping through the graph for querying.

Task: Build a syncmer path graph of the assemblies, then convert the paths into a GBWT for querying.

<details>
<summary>Show syng example command</summary>

```bash
syng -o "$OUT/syng" -writeK -writePath "$FASTA_DIR"/*.fa
syngpath2gbwt "$OUT/syng.1path" "$OUT/syng.1gbwt"
```

</details>

Inputs: a set of FASTA files

Outputs: syng path / kmer files (e.g. `.1path`) and a GBWT (`.1gbwt`)

---



### panagram

[panagram](https://github.com/kjenike/panagram) indexes k-mer presence/absence across genomes for interactive visualisation of various different pangenome metrics for exploratory analysis.

Task: Build a panagram samples table and k-mer index for interactive exploration of presence/absence patterns.

<details>
<summary>Show panagram example command</summary>

```bash
PAN_DIR=$OUT/panagram

## the following step can also be done manually to build a samples file
{
  echo -e "name\tfasta\tgff\tid\tanchor"
  id=0
  for f in "$FASTA_DIR"/*.fa; do
    name=$(basename "$f" .fa)
    echo -e "${name}\tFASTAS/${name}.fa\t\t${id}\tTrue"
    id=$((id+1))
  done
} > "$PAN_DIR/samples.tsv"

cd "$PAN_DIR"
panagram index samples.tsv -k 21 --prepare
snakemake --cores 1 all
```

</details>

Inputs: a `samples.tsv` listing FASTA paths (and optional annotations)

Outputs: a panagram index directory for interactive visualisation

---



### impg

[impg](https://github.com/pangenome/impg) indexes and enables querying of genomic intervals across a pangenome using all-vs-all pairwise genome alignments. Running all pairs alignments is slow without a multi-CPU machine, so for this step we provide pre-computed alignments (`alignments_human.tar.gz` — optional large download; unpacks to `data/human/alignments.paf`). We provide an example command to compute the alignments below for your reference.

<details>
<summary>Show impg align example command</summary>

```bash
impg align --sequence-files "$FASTA_DIR"/*.fa --temp-dir "$OUT/work" -o "$OUT/alignments" --format paf --aligner wfmash
impg index -a "$OUT/alignments/alignments.paf" -i "$OUT/alignments.impg"
```

</details>

Task: Using the index and alignments, build a graph of the MHC region across the set of human genomes ([CHM13 coords](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/genome-stratifications/v3.6/CHM13@all/OtherDifficult/CHM13_MHC.bed.gz) -> chr6:28381448-33301940). Use `-o gfa:seqwish`, which skips the slow smoothing step for the purposes of this tutorial. If you skipped the optional human alignments archive, you can use the pre-built MHC graph under `$DATA/human/mhc/mhc.gfa` for the next (`vg`) section instead.

This step needs the human assemblies (not the yeast example above). Decompress them if you have not already:

```bash
AGC=/data/datasets/human.agc
FASTA_DIR=$OUT/human_fastas
mkdir -p "$FASTA_DIR"
agc getcol -o "$FASTA_DIR" "$AGC"
```

<details>
<summary>Show impg query command</summary>

```bash
impg query -i "$DATA/human/alignments.paf.impg" -a "$DATA/human/alignments.paf" -r "chr6:28381448-33301940" -d 1000 -x -o gfa:seqwish --sequence-files "$FASTA_DIR"/*.fa -O "$OUT/mhc" --aligner wfmash
```

</details>

Inputs: all-vs-all pairwise alignments (PAF) and the corresponding FASTA sequences

Outputs: an `.impg` index and a GFA graph for the queried region

---



### vg

[vg](https://github.com/vgteam/vg) is a toolkit to manipulate variation graphs (such as those produced by impg or [minigraph-cactus](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/blob/master/doc/pangenome.md)). Here we build a Giraffe index for read mapping from a variation graph.

We provide a pre-built MHC graph in GFA format (smoothed) from the previous section.

Task: Build a `vg giraffe` index from a GFA (e.g. the MHC graph from impg). Also build an index for the CHM13 linear sequence (start by isolating the sequence).

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>

```bash
samtools faidx "$FASTA_DIR/chm13v2.0.fa" chr6:28381448-33301940 > "$OUT/mhc_chm13.fa"
# long-read Giraffe indexes (for HiFi / PacBio / ONT)
vg autoindex --workflow lr-giraffe -r "$OUT/mhc_chm13.fa" -p "$OUT/mhc_chm13"

# or use the pre-built MHC GFA from the course data dir: $DATA/human/mhc/mhc.gfa
vg autoindex --workflow lr-giraffe -g "$OUT/mhc.gfa" -p "$OUT/mhc"
```

</details>

Inputs: a variation graph in GFA format

Outputs: long-read Giraffe indexes (e.g. `.giraffe.gbz`, `.dist`, and `.longread.withzip.min` / zipcode files)
